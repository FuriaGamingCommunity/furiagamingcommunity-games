# Furia Gaming Community - Games [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nottu2584/furiagamingcommunity-games.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/nottu2584/furiagamingcommunity-games)
The purpouse of this plugin is to set up different memberships based on your **users played games**, with their own features and forums using both [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) and [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/).
It sets up a new type of post, called **games**, which is used on groups to set an optional played game by its members. Each *game* can have its own character **races**,**classes** and **roles** which are normal **WordPress [taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies)** and can either be shared between games or not.
